# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Lucas!

As a Software Developer, I have worked on commercial projects focused on the areas of e-commerce and bot automation.

I have a higher education degree in Information Technology Management and the knowledge gained during it has been enriching, often making me come up with ideas for innovative implementations in everyday life.

I am always looking for new challenges so that I can continue to progress in my career as an excellent professional.
